            <!--The concept is that sentences will appear when the reader hovers their cursor over them
             disappearing when the reader has shifted their attention to the next one, mimicking the act of reading and keeping
            track of your progress with a finger hovering over the page.-->

            <p class="page">
                <span class="first-sentence">Trace these words with your cursor as you would with your eyes, then keep going.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">See how the text reveals itself as you follow along?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Does it make it easier to read, spacing it out like this?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">But maybe you will agree that this level of interaction can make reading feel more like a conversation?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">With pauses and starts, lending you the agency to continue.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">There is more to conversation than just continuing for its own sake, though, isn’t there?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Be it the topic of choice, or cadence or tone.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">The voice, after all, bears much of the weight of what you hear as a listener, or feel as a speaker.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">But this is just text on a screen, voiceless save for the one in your head as you continue to follow along.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Not to mention it isn't much of a conversation when there is no reply to be made or expected.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Is it engaging nonetheless?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Meditative, even?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">I must admit, it is quite therapeutic writing all of this.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Arbitrary word count notwithstanding.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Now here I am taking on the burden of conversation, despite just expounding on how pointless it was.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Conversation through static text, that is, not the premise of conversing itself.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">It is quite a valuable form of communication after all; sociable, humane, uniquely flawed and complex.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Is rambling conversation?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">I digress, that is not the point of the text, rather it is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this webpage implementation to communicate the ideas related to the prompts I have chosen.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">However, I do think it’s more enjoyable to demonstrate through the form.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">What have I got to lose?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">This is an experiment on form, after all; no experiment's worth taking without risk.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">We'll 'experiment' then, and see how well it reads below.&nbsp</span>
                <br>
                <span class="sentence"><em>“I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:&nbsp</em></span>
                <span class="sentence"><em>1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.&nbsp</em></span>
                <span class="sentence"><em>2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.&nbsp</em></span>
                <span class="sentence"><em>3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”&nbsp</em></span>
                <span class="sentence"><strong>-Douglas Adams,</strong> <em>The Salmon of Doubt</em></span>
                <span class="sentence">So how was that?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Was it so different from just reading text the usual way?&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">I’m asking questions again, but only now am I realising that I do it as much for myself as for putting content on this page.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">Anyway, I hope the point of the implementation was not lost in the weeds.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="sentence">In any case, I’ll speak plain here:&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">The principles of reading are often overlooked as the struggle that it is for some neurodivergent people.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">Whether it be the struggle to focus, or find engagement in it, it remains an activity that could be afford to be more accessible in this day and age.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">Speaking from experience, as one with ADHD, it had made more sense to blame my struggles with keeping my focus trained on pages upon pages of text to some kind of mental incapacity, rather than the neurodevelopmental disorder that it is.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">I used to love reading.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">When I was younger, I would bury myself in book after book.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">Over time, however, my attention eroded little by little, until I could barely get through a page without my mind drifting...&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">and forcing myself to follow along only ended in frustration and disappointment.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">There do exist means of making reading more accessible already.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="dyslexia-sentence">Dyslexia-friendly fonts exist, as does the concept of <strong>Bio</strong>nic <strong>Read</strong>ing.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">I would like to present this as an attempt to contribute to that kind of accessibility, addressing it in a way that I feel works for myself.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">Where focus is self-directed, imprintable, and never moves on faster than you’d be ready to.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">I can already imagine the ways that I could expand on this concept, as well as the ways I have fallen short of other needs I failed to address.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">However, I feel that this prototype can stand on its own as it is, as a simple, almost rudimentary implementation of a standard of reading that could one day become just as imminently accessible as it once was for me.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">Even writing and reading this back has reminded me of that feeling.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="plain-sentence">Thank you for following along.&nbsp</span>
                <span class="end">END.&nbsp</span>
