        <h1>A1 - Interative Experience Research Project</h1>

        <ol>
            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
                <p>The entire web experience was an arresting affair from its very loading screen to the erratic interactions to follow.
                    At first blush, you are met with a heavily distorted textual proclamation that "It's now safe to turn off your computer." a claim so boldly made
                    as to be provocative, immediately shedding all preconceptions that it is a traditional website.
                    While merely looking at something could often be discounted as 'true' interaction, a case could be made for the necessity of attention in 
                    Nathalie Lawhead's 'Tetrageddon', where the act of seeing is leveraged as something it both abuses(at times) and criticizes.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
                <p>The interface of the experience is at once familiar and completely foreign, in much the same way the ruined detritus of an 
                    apocalyptic city could be considered relatable. The work itself exists as a faux desktop space, utterly condensed with egregious popups and
                    widgets, so physically removed from the common understanding of a computer desktop that buttons literally fall in space as if weighed down by gravity.
                    To say that it is a visual overload is an understatement; Tetrageddon invokes its nomenclature by reflecting a hellscape of interactivity.
                    There is almost too much to interact with, as the briefest interactions lead to completely separate pages, with their own interactions built in.
                    At the very least, one can conclude that the polluted desktop IS the thing one interfaces with mainly, but even that is swiftly turned on its head.
                </p>
            <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
                <p>
                    'Left Click' pulls much of its weight here, as I was given no shortage of objects to click on. From familiar (at first glance) windows and their disappearing buttons 
                    to barely parsable artwork whose reactions were often difficult to tell whether they were affected by my Click or some other arcane action embedded in the work. Nontheless,
                    to click was the only way forward in Tetrageddon, even if it may often seem like the space itself lives on its own. 
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
                <p>
                    The surreal and irreverent nature of the work makes it difficult to truly define the artist's primary message, if any at all. 
                    I would, however, claim that Tetrageddon is up for interpretation, and that the messaging behind it is intended to be multifaceted and variable, much like the internet it resides within.
                    There is absolutely no way that an experience of this density has nothing to say; so my interpretation is thus: The realm of cyberspace is at once alive and static, relying upon human interaction
                    to meaningfully progress. The internet is a biosphere which is a reflection of itself and what we, as users, put into it; Tetrageddon only puts a mirror to that concept.
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li>
                <p>
                    Because my own interpretation is all I would have to go with, in regards to this question, I would say that in my brief experience with Tetrageddon, it has certainly made a strong impression on me.
                    Its ideas are presented in overstimulating and macabre fashion, but such a delivery is crucial in communicating the messages it sets forth as a whole. To parody internet use, one must be willing to 
                    provoke it to its very extremes, else it fall flat and leaves the user closing the tab (and for good.)
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
                <p>
                    I believe that the experience warrants one full 'playthrough' to fully examine how it is constructed, as much of the content is hidden and embedded in truly esoteric fashion. One may miss things
                    from one playthrough to another, purely because of the website's eccentric presentation.
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
                <p>
                    The unpredictability of Tetrageddon obfuscates what could be commonly understood as a 'Point-and-Click' game, wherein the main mode of interaction is clicking on different interactive objects at a time in order
                    to progress the experience. However, because of its conceptual framing being that of a desktop, what one can call 'progress' is mostly non-linear, prompting the user to interface with every visible object (if not pixel)
                    of the everchanging landscape. Some commonalities with 'Point-and-Click' games that it shares lineage with does include an increasing vocabulary of verbs which the user builds up through interaction alone. This concept being present here 
                    implies that the best way to discover Tetrageddon's foremost secrets is simply to interact with it on its own level; clicking through and allowing one's own curiosity reveal the dents in its obfuscation, before piercing through them.
                </p>
            <li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li>
                <p>
                    Based on its interactions alone, 'Tetrageddon' immediately brings to mind the point-and-click adventure games of the 90s, following the time-tested formula of clicking various objects to see how they react. Early depictions of cyberspace, as well as computers themselves
                    also serve as direct inspirations, both visually and aesthetically.
                </p>
            <li>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</li>
                <p>
                    Such interaction is key in understanding 'Tetrageddon's' thesis, as each interaction serves to inform the user's forthcoming action. How will this button change the state of the page? What are the effects of interacting with the windows? While it 
                    is logical to expect an outcome for this mode of interaction, 'Tetrageddon's' commentary on the capricious nature of cyberspace is that a lot of these interactions simply do nothing at all.
                </p>
            <li>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</li>
                <p>
                    There is no small amount of nostalgia to be had from experiencing 'Tetrageddon', with its simple mode of interaction and the setpiece of a primitive Graphical User Interface dragged through Hell. The work captures the tone of how it must have been to catch a computer virus of apocalyptic proportions in the early days of computing.
                    It is a simple matter to assume that the developer intended for the experience to be overstimulating for its own sake, but there is an intentionality in the deployment of certain elements (Cookies, Ironic Pop-up Ads, etc.) present in the work which hints to a much deeper relationship with the technology, and a more complicated thesis than just 'The Internet is an overwhelming place.'
                </p>
            <li>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</li>
            <p>
                Perhaps the work's inscrutable nature can be frustrating to deal with at times, especially when enough of the interactions follow logic that isn't immediately apparent. In that vein, the work itself relies on browser manipulation such as pop-ups and opening new pages, and it was during one of my interactions where I accidentally disabled pop-ups, which prevented me from seeing further interactions of the sort down the line.
            </p>
            <li>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</li>
            <p>
                Frustrations aside, it is the surprises and humour behind 'Tetrageddon' which makes it such a profound insight into not just the history of the internet as we know it, but with how we interface with it as well. While clicking may be the primary action required to progress, dragging cookies around, typing screams to textboxes, and generally just marvelling at the transforming landscape before you proved to be spots of brightness amidst the chaos.
