        <h1>A1 - Interative Experience Research Project</h1>

        <ol>
            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
                <p>The entire web experience was an arresting affair from its very loading screen to the erratic interactions to follow.
                    At first blush, you are met with a heavily distorted textual proclamation that "It's now safe to turn off your computer." a claim so boldly made
                    as to be provocative, immediately shedding all preconceptions that it is a traditional website.
                    While merely looking at something could often be discounted as 'true' interaction, a case could be made for the necessity of attention in 
                    Nathalie Lawhead's 'Tetrageddon', where the act of seeing is leveraged as something it both abuses(at times) and criticizes.

            </li>
            <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
                <p>The interface of the experience is at once familiar and completely foreign, in much the same way the ruined detritus of an 
                    apocalyptic city could be considered relatable. The work itself exists as a faux desktop space, utterly condensed with egregious popups and
                    widgets, so physically removed from the common understanding of a computer desktop that buttons literally fall in space as if weighed down by gravity.
                    To say that it is a visual overload is an understatement; Tetrageddon invokes its nomenclature by reflecting a hellscape of interactivity.
                    There is almost too much to interact with, as the briefest interactions lead to completely separate pages, with their own interactions built in.
                    At the very least, one can conclude that the polluted desktop IS the thing one interfaces with mainly, but even that is swiftly turned on its head.
                </p>
            <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
                <p>
                    'Left Click' pulls much of its weight here, as I was given no shortage of objects to click on. From familiar (at first glance) windows and their disappearing buttons 
                    to barely parsable artwork whose reactions were often difficult to tell whether they were affected by my Click or some other arcane action embedded in the work. Nontheless,
                    to click was the only way forward in Tetrageddon, even if it may often seem like the space itself lives on its own. 
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
                <p>
                    The surreal, 'Dada-ist' nature of the work makes it difficult to truly define the artist's primary message, if any at all. 
                    I would, however, claim that Tetrageddon is up for interpretation, and that the messaging behind it is intended to be multifaceted and variable, much like the internet it resides within.
                    There is absolutely no way that an experience of this density has nothing to say; so my interpretation is thus: The realm of cyberspace is at once alive and static, relying upon human interaction
                    to meaningfully progress. The internet is a biosphere which is a reflection of itself and what we, as users, put into it; Tetrageddon only puts a mirror to that concept.
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li>
                <p>
                    Because my own interpretation is all I would have to go with, in regards to this question, I would say that in my brief experience with Tetrageddon, it has certainly made a strong impression on me.
                    Its ideas are presented in overstimulating and macabre fashion, but such a delivery is crucial in communicating the messages it sets forth as a whole. To parody internet use, one must be willing to 
                    provoke it to its very extremes, else it fall flat and leaves the user closing the tab (and for good.)
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
                <p>
                    I believe that the experience warrants one full 'playthrough' to fully examine how it is constructed, as much of the content is hidden and embedded in truly esoteric fashion. One may miss things
                    from one playthrough to another, purely because of the website's eccentric presentation.
                </p>
            <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?
                <p>
                    The unpredictability of Tetrageddon obfuscates what could be commonly understood as a 'Point-and-Click' game, wherein the main mode of interaction is clicking on different interactive objects at a time in order
                     to progress the experience. However, because of its conceptual framing being that of a desktop, what one can call 'progress' is mostly non-linear, prompting the user to interface with every visible object (if not pixel)
                      of the everchanging landscape. Some commonalities with 'Point-and-Click' games that it shares lineage with does include an increasing vocabulary of verbs which the user builds up through interaction alone. This concept being present here 
                      implies that the best way to discover Tetrageddon's foremost secrets is simply to interact with it on its own level; clicking through and allowing one's own curiosity reveal the dents in its obfuscation, before piercing through them.
